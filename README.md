# forkify project

Food recipe application with recipe bookmarks and custom recipe uploads. Allows users to bookmarks their favorite recipes and add their own, customized recipes to the app. Stores the user's favorite recipes from various sources in one place.

The first version of this app was built as part of a Udemy course for JavaScript web development. The second version will include additional features and improvements that I added outside of the scope of the course project.
